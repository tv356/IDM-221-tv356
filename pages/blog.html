      <p>The line “Export Successful" appeared on my laptop screen. I felt a mix of relief and excitement. Imagining all my hard work being shared by numerous Facebook users, I grinned from ear to ear. I closed the file, created a new artboard on Illustrator, and proceeded with my personal project. Today, I'd be recreating the image of a Vietnamese traditional garment for women in the 2000s, the "Áo Dài".</p>

      <p>Using Pentool, I sketched the model’s figure. Pentool is the most fundamental tool of Illustrator; it brought back memories of the first time I practiced drawing on a computer. Despite my passion for drawing, my first creation was messy and impossible to decipher. Yet, Pentool allowed me to reshape the drawing, creating a work of art that went on to win the First Prize in a local art competition. Most importantly, Pentool helped me take my dreams from imaginations to reality: I founded LOVIV, a non-profit organization that helps promote equal opportunities for HIV-infected children. I created Lalin, a student-run project that works to change Vietnamese's prejudices against pursuing careers in the arts. Thus, I used Pentool to draw myself as the model, who would later wear “Áo dài". As I finished my sketch of the model, I drew a circle representing "Bánh dày" and a rectangle representing "Bánh chưng", traditional cakes of Vietnam; a triangle representing "Nón lá" - the traditional hat of Vietnam; and lastly the shapes of the Áo dài.</p>

      <p>Oops! I made a mistake in the patterning of Ao dai. Ctrl + Z would undo my action. The misplaced shape was erased quickly; just like a mistake in coloring could be corrected easily. I always wished the Undo button existed in real life, so I could forget memories of the teacher that physically abused me when I was 4, or the cousin that sexually abused me when I was 8. Yet without the magic of the Undo tool, I took actions: I joined Sex Speak Organization and raised awareness of sexual harassment, helping over 30 children suffering with PTSD from sexual abuse to reintegrate into society via education.</p>

      <p>I moved on to the final stage of my artwork – coloring. Using my favorite tools - Eyedropper and Brush, I picked colors for each of the patterns. I have always been praised for my eye for color. When I first used these tools, I played with the colors, combining different ones for hours. If Pentool allowed the most fundamental of processes, Eyedropper and Brush would be the tool which allowed my creative spirit to flow through my artworks. The blank artboard now came alive with with the image of a girl with long, black hair, sparkling eyes, and a big smile, wearing a red Ao dai and holding a lotus - Vietnamese national flower. With Pentool, Undo,  Eyedropper, and Brush, my drawing - a part of my "100 years of Ao dai" project but also the representation of my beliefs - was now ready to be “Exported”.</p>

      <p>The journey to find myself is like drawing a picture, the memories and experiences being the colors which excite it. Being physically and sexually abused does not make the picture of my life monotonous. I entered the design industry as a total novice, yet with practice, I got better. Finally, I have got the confidence to leave my mark in this kingdom. </p>

      <p>At seventeen, I can be distracted and curious. My passion for design is the beaconing light that guides me home if I am lost. The tools in Illustrator have excelled my experience; not only did they help me finish my project, draw 100 years of “Áo dài”, but they have also enabled me to draw my life. I’ve become opened up to new adventures that I am determined to embark on. My mission, now, is to bring color to the lives of others.</p>
