### About Me

I am Cheryl Vo. I am an international student from Vietnam. I have been working in different positions such as an intern, a
part-time, and a president in a student-based organization. In any positions, I pride myself on being a determined worker.
Though when it comes to making decisions, I sometimes get hestitate and take long time to decide.

In childhood, I was always dreamed of founding an art organization since the arts in any form were not developed. There were
limited art museums, exhibitions, workshops, and art academy. In grade 10, I wanted to pursue that dream and started to set
my goal of founding an art organization. I came to almost every art museum in Vietnam. I volunteered to be a staff for many
art exhibitions of well-known artists in Vietnam. I also participated in non-profit organizations to gain more experience and
enhance my leadership skills.

After graduated from high school, I left my country (Vietnam) and flew to the US to pursue higher education at Drexel
University. I initially studied Graphic Design major. However, after 2 quarters, I realize that Graphic Design is not
suitable for me, so I decided to change my major to Interactive Digital Media instead. At the moment, I enjoy studying about
UX/UI fields, and I am looking forward to more opportunities.
